# webtasks

Asynchronous tasks and websockets for ClojureScript

As this is a pre-release version **webtasks** has not been
published to [Clojars](https://clojars.org/). You can still clone it and install
it locally.

Check out the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)

The motivation for **webtasks** is to implement a simple, asychronous
task framework for ClojureScript *a la* [Zach Tellman's](http://ideolalia.com/) [manifold](https://github.com/ztellman/manifold) library.
When the tests and API docs are ready we'll drop a link in
issue [#2](https://github.com/ztellman/manifold/issues/2).

## Documentation

The **webtasks** library was developed to support the [PAMELA](https://github.com/dollabs/pamela) suite of tools.

See the [API docs](http://dollabs.github.io/webtasks/doc/api/)

## Building

The **webtasks** library uses [boot](http://boot-clj.com/) as a build tool.

Check [here for more information on setting up boot](https://github.com/dollabs/plan-schema#building).

You can install **webtasks** locally with `boot local`.

You can get help for all available boot tasks with `boot -h`.
